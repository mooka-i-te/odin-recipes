    <h3>Directions :</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
        Cook the rice vermicelli and the edamame beans according to the packet instructions. <br>
        Rinse under running cold water until cooled completely, drain and set aside. 
    </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Step 2</strong>
        Using a vegetable peeler, peel ribbons down the length of the carrot. <br>
        Gather these together and very roughly chop them so you have thin, mismatched strips of carrot. 
    </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Step 3</strong>
        Fill a deep roasting tray or container that’s large enough to hold the rice paper wrappers <br>
        with 2–3cm/1in cold water. Dampen a clean work surface with a little water.
    </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Step 4</strong>
        To assemble the rolls: one at a time, submerge the rice paper wrappers <br>
        in the cold water for a couple of seconds, then place on the damp work surface. <br>
        Place a pinch of rice vermicelli just below the centre of the rice paper. 
    </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Step 5</strong>
        Add 3–4 prawns and top with some carrot, radish, mint, coriander and edamame. <br>
        Fold the sides of the rice paper in to the centre, then bring the side closest to <br>
        you up and over the filling. 
    </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Step 6</strong>
        Roll forward while pulling back to create a little tension in the roll <br>
        and roll up until it is completely sealed. Put on a serving plate and repeat until you’ve used all <br>
        the rice paper. Serve immediately, alongside the two dipping sauces.

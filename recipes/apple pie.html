<h3>Directions :</h3>

<p>
    <strong>step 1</strong><br>
    For the pastry, put the flour, sugar and lemon zest in a bowl.<br>
    Rub in the butter until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. <br>
    Add the beaten egg and stir with a round-bladed knife until the mixture forms a dough.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>step 2</strong><br>
    Set aside one-third of the pastry for the lid. <br>
    Roll out the remaining pastry on a lightly floured surface until the thickness of a pound coin <br>
    and 5–7cm/2–3in larger than the pie dish. Lift the pastry over the rolling pin and lower <br>
    it gently into the pie dish.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>step 3</strong><br>
    Press the pastry firmly into the dish and up the sides, making sure there are no air bubbles. <br>
    Chill the pastry in the fridge while you prepare the filling.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>step 4</strong><br>
    Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. <br>
    Place a baking tray into the oven to preheat.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>step 5</strong><br>
    For the filling, mix the sugar, cinnamon and cornflour in a large bowl. <br>
    Stir in the apples until coated.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>step 6</strong><br>
    Put the apple filling in the pie dish, making sure that it rises above the sides of the dish <br>
    (particularly in the middle). Brush the rim of the pastry with beaten egg.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>step 7</strong><br>
    Roll out the reserved ball of pastry to make the pie lid. <br>
    Cover the pie with the pastry lid and press the edges together firmly to seal. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>step 8</strong><br>
    Using a sharp knife, trim off the excess pastry, then gently crimp all around the edge. <br>
    Make a few small holes in the centre of the pie with the tip of a knife or a skewer. <br>
    Glaze the top with beaten egg.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>step 9</strong><br>
    Lightly knead the pastry trimmings and re-roll. Cut into leaf shapes and arrange <br>
    all around the edge of the pie, slightly overlapping each other. Glaze with more egg. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>step 10</strong><br>
    Sprinkle the pie with sugar and bake in the centre of the oven <br>
    for 45–55 minutes or until golden-brown all over and the apples are tender
</p>
<p>
    <strong>step 11</strong><br>
    Serve warm or cold with cream, custard or ice cream.

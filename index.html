    <div id="link" class="apple"><a href="recipes/apple pie.html"> ✧ Apple pie</a>
        <p class="text">Apple pie is a classic American dessert made with a flaky pastry crust filled with sweet and tart apples that are seasoned with cinnamon, sugar, and sometimes other spices. The filling is typically encased in the crust and baked until the apples are tender and the crust is golden brown.</p>

    <div id="link" class="lemon"><a href="recipes/lemon cookies.html">✧ Lemon cookies</a>
        <p>Soft lemon cookies that are perfectly light, not cakey, are so simple to make! They’re just the thing when you want something sweet but not too sweet. The tart lemon flavor balances the sweetness in the cookie and makes having just one basically impossible! </p>

    <div id="link" class="roll"><a href="recipes/spring rolls.html"> ✧ Spring rolls</a>
        <p>Spring rolls are rolled appetizers or dim sum commonly found in Chinese, Vietnamese, Malaysian and Southeast Asian cuisines. The kind of wrapper, fillings, and cooking technique used, as well as the name, vary considerably depending on the region's culture, though they are generally filled with vegetables and ground beef or pork.</p>
